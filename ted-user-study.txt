Calories page:
  Allow user to put in a goal for calories that they want to complete now (maybe # servings too?)
  Click on food for location or recipie?
  Grammar: "you currently are x calories toward..." not "you currently have x calories toward..."

General: 
  Clicking on things should bring down options (directions, details, etc) in addition to option for logging on fitbit
  Use localstorage to remember searches when navigating back from other pages (e.g. gmaps)
  Truncate numbers properly (don't want 155.99999)
  Bottom footer overtakes some of the page content
  Fix homepage css glitch for mobile/smaller screen
  Make main pages fit to screen size when there is no other content (map div in venues should have height:0 when hidden)
  Desktop: Use mouse finger pointer icon thing on anything clickable (so there isn't just a cursor)
  Back button (in browser, or app): Should it bring back to a previous search, or previous page?
  Fitbit logo should link to homepage
  Stylize logo better (match fitbit font)
